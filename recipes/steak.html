    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>We won't get into the fiery debate between charcoal versus gas grills here â€” 
        we've covered that in depth. But for certain, great grilling can be had with either charcoal or gas.
        We've also covered how to pick the best steak for grilling. 
        The good news is, the perfect steak doesn't need to be the most expensive.
         If breaking the bank isn't part of your barbeque plan, consider less spendy sirloin, 
         hanger, flank steak, and skirt steaks.</p>
    <p><strong>Choose cuts that are at least 1-inch thick.</strong>If the steak is too thin, 
        the interior gets cooked well-done before the exterior can develop the crave-worthy crust. 
        \If you can, choose steaks of even thickness so they'll be done at the same time. Also, meat 
        near the bone will take a little longer to cook.</p>
    <p><strong>Marinade and Rubs.</strong> The ideal steak marinade combines acid, fat, and seasonings. 
        The acid creates a tangy flavor foundation and tenderizes the meat; the fat adds flavor, 
        seals in juices, helps keep the meat from sticking to the grill, and promotes caramelization; 
        and the seasonings complete the flavor profile. Here's a breakdown of The Best Steak Marinade 
        in Existence.</p>
    <p>Rubs are another way to go. These simple seasoning mixtures infuse grilled steaks with exciting flavors. 
        The best rubs enhance the natural smoky flavors of the grilled meat without overwhelming it. Add a 
        little oil, vinegar, or other liquid to the mix, and you have a wet rub. Let rubbed meats sit for anywhere 
        from 30 minutes to overnight. Now that you've prepped your meat, <strong>learn step-by-step how to cook steak 
        on the grill:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>If your steak was marinating, wipe off the wet marinade with a paper towel, then set it down on the 
                hot grill and <em>leave it alone for several minutes without turning.</em></li>
            <li>After a few minutes, the meat will release its grip on the grill, and you can turn it without tearing the 
                meat; If you start to turn it, and it's still gripping the grill, just give it another minute.</li>
            <li><strong>Sear steaks over high, direct heat, then move them to indirect heat</strong> to finish cooking. That's the most 
                common method. But if you like to live dangerously, do it in reverse: start with indirect cooking, with 
                the lid on, and then finish with a quick, high-heat sear. You'll get the same results: a juicy steak with 
                a crisp, caramelized crust.</li>
            <li>Once your steak is done to your liking, remove it to a plate and <strong>let it sit for at least 5 minutes before 
                serving or slicing.</strong></li>
        </ol>
